                    <h2>Our Heritage</h2>
                    <p>
                        For over three decades, our family has been at the forefront of preserving and promoting 
                        the rich tradition of Assamese silk weaving. What started as a small venture driven by 
                        passion has grown into a trusted name for authentic handwoven silk garments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our journey began in the heart of Assam, where the art of silk weaving is not just a 
                        craft but a way of life. Inspired by the timeless beauty of traditional Assamese textiles, 
                        we dedicated ourselves to bringing these exquisite creations to discerning customers who 
                        appreciate genuine craftsmanship.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Every piece in our collection tells a story—a story of skilled artisans, traditional 
                        techniques passed down through generations, and the natural beauty of Assam's finest silk.

                    <h3>Muga Silk - The Golden Thread</h3>
                    <p>
                        Muga silk is exclusive to Assam and is known for its natural golden color and exceptional 
                        durability. This precious silk is produced by semi-domesticated silkworms that feed on 
                        som and sualu leaves. The resulting fabric has a distinctive golden sheen that grows 
                        richer with age.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Pat Silk - The Pristine Beauty</h3>
                    <p>
                        Pat silk, also known as Mulberry silk, is celebrated for its soft texture and lustrous 
                        white appearance. Assamese weavers create stunning designs on Pat silk, making it perfect 
                        for both traditional and contemporary garments.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Eri Silk - The Fabric of Peace</h3>
                    <p>
                        Eri silk, often called the "fabric of peace," is produced without harming the silkworms. 
                        Known for its thermal properties and soft texture, Eri silk is ideal for shawls and 
                        winter garments.

                    Every garment in our collection is handwoven by master artisans who have dedicated their 
                    lives to perfecting the craft of silk weaving. These skilled weavers, often working from 
                    their homes in rural Assam, carry forward techniques that have been passed down through 
                    generations.
