                    <h3>Muga Silk — The Golden Treasure</h3>
                    <p>
                        Muga silk is exclusive to Assam and is renowned worldwide for its natural golden color and 
                        exceptional durability. This precious silk is produced by semi-domesticated silkworms that 
                        feed on som and sualu leaves found only in Assam. The resulting fabric has a distinctive 
                        golden sheen that actually grows richer and more lustrous with age, making Muga silk garments 
                        treasured heirlooms passed down through generations.

                    <h3>Pat Silk — The Pristine Beauty</h3>
                    <p>
                        Pat silk, also known as Mulberry silk, is celebrated for its soft texture and lustrous white 
                        appearance. Assamese weavers create stunning designs on Pat silk using traditional techniques, 
                        incorporating vibrant colored motifs and intricate borders. The versatility of Pat silk makes 
                        it perfect for both traditional garments and contemporary designs, suitable for various 
                        occasions from formal events to cultural celebrations.

                    <h3>Eri Silk — The Fabric of Peace</h3>
                    <p>
                        Eri silk, often called the "fabric of peace," is produced without harming the silkworms, 
                        making it a sustainable and ethical choice. Known for its thermal properties and soft, 
                        cotton-like texture, Eri silk is ideal for shawls and winter garments. It provides warmth 
                        without weight and has excellent moisture absorption properties, making it comfortable in 
                        various climates.
